Hello readers, who I have never greeted, so now I greet you at this time and now I will discuss something light about food and personality, is there anything to do with it? Just for fun according to my perspective, People who like to eat spicy food are usually open-minded and tend to be rude although not everything is like this and people with this type of food should be avoided creating a conflict because it will get complicated<br>  <br>  People who like sweet are usually more towards something soft and don't like a split or you could say they love peace and relationally should be more and they tend to avoid conflict with others, People who like salty then they are the type who is sensitive to their feelings as well as others and tend to be easily hurt if hurt is not easy to forgive so it must be guarded against feelings if someone has friends with this type of food<br>  <br>  People who like to be bland in their food, they tend to be unpretentious and don't care what other people say and of course in friendship they are very selective, once they have friends, they will be overprotective which makes their friends uncomfortable. my version? If it fits then it's just a coincidence and don't take it seriously okay..!!!
