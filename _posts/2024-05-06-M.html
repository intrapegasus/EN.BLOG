Are you one of those who follow the market or not when you are selling or when you are running a business? Which is better than this option? If someone follows the market, they must understand what is going viral, for example, there was an agate trend in the past and then everyone talked about agate as well as the toy trend which all sells about toys. lose too much <br>  <br>  Remember that trends don't always work that way and as much as possible the stock is sold out before the trend really drops or disappears also stop for a moment to think about other strategies from that time frame to evaluate whether selling against the trend from time to time makes a profit or not. even minus to decide whether or not to continue doing business using this model<br>  <br>  Continuing to sell without using trends means that you are independent who doesn't care whether something is viral or not viral so keep doing business, this business model is actually good besides you who are more daring to be consistent but not necessarily profitable, the payback takes quite a long time before finally make a profit besides that you have to issue more about promotion actively to introduce what the advantages of your product are because it is different from the trend-following business model where he no longer needs advertising because everyone already knows it because of word of mouth then this one if there is no advertising then the product will be difficult to sell<br>  <br>  Both options have pluses and minuses depending on what you're doing, viral selling is usually in the form of goods, but if you sell things that don't use trends, it's usually related to services, but that doesn't mean you can't buy goods, of course you can, but remember that if the inventory is too long, it can be damaged. no exception for certain foods or goods so it is something unusual in a business that does not or does not use trends
