When love is one sided then there must be another hand that welcomes in this case is love between humans and then what about humans and God? It&#39;s definitely more onesided clapping but it&#39;s good that God still gives blessings to people who are negligent, when I was looking for a religion and god long ago I studied many religions and traveled here and there and exchanged ideas about what their beliefs were thinking, I looked for answers whether the religion was wrong or the person was wrong and it turned out that the answer was the person alone not the religion because every religion teaches kindness to fellow human beings<br>  <br>  I didn&#39;t believe in God when I was down but I can prove that God exists even when I become like a public enemy, it can still be changed by presenting the right person to answer my problem without being asked and without interaction with anyone, even me and her don&#39;t talk to each other. I knew before then from there I felt that it was true that God was there because it was in accordance with the solution of the problem and did not stray anywhere<br>  <br>  My worries so far have not happened and God did not want something bad even though I look fragile but I am not broken, if I am broken then I am not currently writing this article because I have ended my life because I drank poison too when I was depressed. and that&#39;s my dark period and I&#39;m still alive today and grateful for the blessings that God has given sincerely and no longer question why I am like this, why am I like that, just do what I can do today as best as I can then that&#39;s how I am grateful for life, if it is still alive and it is not time to die then it will not make me die unless it is destiny and all my life is in the destiny ordained by God.
