This time I learned that failure is not the end of everything, but when you fail, the most important thing is whether a person can get back up or not. I did experience failure in making something like EOL-112222 and other projects because I also understand that idealism is not something that is too bad. good to be maintained properly regardless of whether or not a process can be continued in the future

M for Mumbo and W for Wumbo, this is Patrick's joke and indeed sometimes you don't need to be a smart and idealistic figure, you don't need a class or academic champion because it's all just nonsense, the most important thing is that we realize that everyone has a role each of them, no one is all smart, no one is all stupid, no one is all rich, no one is all poor, they all have a role and there is no equality in life, believe me.
