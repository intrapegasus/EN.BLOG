A long time ago I remember someone said about me, 'Why are men in the kitchen? and actually it's not wrong because I have to be a man who doesn't rely on the ability of a woman to do housework, but I as a man must be able to do it so that later when I get married I can help my wife because household tasks must be done together. can be alone, If I stop by my brother's house, of course, I know what I can do, so just do it without having to wait to be told to wash dirty dishes, if there are glass plates that have not been cleaned, then take out the trash and the like, so I'm not a spoiled child because I'm used to living it. everything alone without anyone's help<br>  <br>  For household matters I still have to learn more of course little by little in order to understand and understand being a father later or the head of a family who is responsible not only for office matters or work at work but at home too, so please ask for prayers for those of you who read the article This is so that I can be fluent in studying household so that I can become all-rounder.
