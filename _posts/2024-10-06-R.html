title: Apps Not Compatible

Actually I'm confused about what title to give, but that's the title because yesterday I was thinking about how to install applications that don't support or are not compatible and nothing really works, The first is if the operating system is updated from the old version to the older version. it is clear that this must have been supported, but with a note that according to the application, it is not new in our opinion because of course it cannot install even though it has gone up one level but the application is several levels above for the version of the android operating system<br>  <br>  The second is to look for the version of the application that at that time supports the operating system that we currently have on our device but the problem is that the server is turned off so when logging in or entering the application there is a warning telling us to update to the version of the most recent application so again and again Again, this method fails again, but not all of them, if the offline version or the one that doesn't require an update, will run smoothly<br>  <br>  The third is the dummy method according to my logic, which is to tear apart the application by downgrading the android version according to the current version used and make the application one again but still getting an error, I don't know why, because something crashed when re-uniting or it crashed from the start but This method really doesn't work, the possibility of failure is solid<br>  <br>  That's the end of a failed installation and at the same time answering the curiosity of anyone who wants to know if you find such a case with the possibilities that exist according to common sense logic of course there are more failures but that's why I tried it instead of not trying so I don't know if it failed or succeeded
