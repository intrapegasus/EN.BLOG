I first disclaim that this is my opinion and my taste and it may be different from other people's perspectives so if you are a woman and it doesn't match what is said here, don't be offended because everyone has their own criteria and vice versa women against men too have the criteria, I like women who have a broken home background too because I am a broken home I hope to be wiser in thinking so I don't repeat the same incident as my parents used to me and this broken home woman because children are the most important priority after marriage<br>  <br>  I like women who have patience and are strong in dealing with the ups and downs of life because life is not as beautiful as Korean dramas or soap operas in general, so it must be prepared so as not to be surprised because anyone does not want this to happen including me but we are looking for a way out together and strengthening each other, Disability is not a problem or a bad family background even though the important thing is that there is an intention to improve because no human being is born perfect on this earth so I respect any shortcomings of women, The last thing is that don't need to be beautiful because being beautiful is just a bonus, because I'm not handsome either, so the most important thing for a woman is a good heart because the household journey is not only a year or two but a lifetime, so you have to have a big heart towards your husband and children so that can stay strong in a household relationship.
