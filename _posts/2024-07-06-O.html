Not that the money is burned using fire, but this is a strategy in marketing that is generally used by corporations and is it good? Advertising needs a good strategy to produce closing if it's just an advertisement without planning then what happens is money is wasted but the income is not satisfactory and this also applies to non-corporate businesses because the sweetness of advertising is not as sweet as the profits <br>  <br>  The price war that occurs does not make consumers loyal without being equipped with the advantages that exist in the products that are owned by us, if we have what our competitors don't have then we should be able to attract more interest, consumers are just moving, no one is loyal then if If there is a promotion, immediately move to a competitor, so you have to prepare a strategy <br>  <br>  As a businessman, you can provide needs for all so that the segmentation is wider, for example, there are goods at low prices that are adjusted to the specifications to even the most expensive goods, as well as services, so it is not a problem of high profits at high prices because there is also a lot of lower market share, so don't worry. always play above, our job as a businessman is closing not profit, it doesn't matter how small it is that is important to be loyal rather than big but unpredictable because of the dynamics of moving consumers to competitors so that it repeats again burning money without closing
