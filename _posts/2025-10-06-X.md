There is a story where the figure of this person is very poor, and a miracle comes to him and he becomes someone who is very rich. Many people think that poverty is a barrier to success, but in fact it is not, there are many mysterious factors that occur in life because when we see something that is minus or lacking, we tend to underestimate or belittle or even insult someone who is poor. earlier, the key to the poor person was that he was persistent in trying to also pray and do something good according to what he could do.

Whereas someone who is rich, he feels he doesn't need to do anything, all facilities are there and far from a sense of distress but when someone who is rich cannot use the facilities properly and correctly then what happens? Falling poor and very shocked and even unable to live life with a poor condition and unable to make peace with his new life at this time, we know that the rich and the poor actually have an X factor which is both dangerous and equally risky, a comfortable life is not always comfortable as well as a difficult life not always difficult, keep trying what you can do today so that when the day comes when the world is turned upside down, you won't be surprised.
