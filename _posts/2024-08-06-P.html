title: Truth Is Relative
tags: [diary]

There is no absolute or absolute truth in life because the truth only comes from God, if there is still truth in humans, there is only the possibility that it is an error in carrying out God&#39;s commands or is right but based on his own beliefs so of course this is relative. I&#39;m also not always right, so other people can be right and vice versa I can be right and other people are wrong, depending on who they see, even if their actions are right but the person is hated, their actions can be considered wrong and cannot be tolerated and are considered absolute mistakes. Therefore, humans never judge both truth and error from an objective perspective<br>  <br>  Humans only judge based on subjective, namely against liking or disliking other people, humans. It is more difficult to listen than to speak, so there is a prolonged conflict and there is no common ground, so that&#39;s how the truth is just a fictional thing that doesn&#39;t necessarily happen and can&#39;t be believed before it exists. other people make corrections but of course for me personally it is also not easy to accept corrections and it is easier and likes to receive compliments even though it may lead me down but I feel comfortable, you are right I am right, you are wrong I am wrong, how about this? Is it even more terrifying? Please answer yourself and reflect on everything especially for myself personally too
