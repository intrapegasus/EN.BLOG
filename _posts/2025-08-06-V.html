In making this article, I thought repeatedly about what I wanted to write until I finally remembered it now because this post should have been at the beginning of the post in October, so now I just want to write it on this blog, I was fun at first to find out what that's all there is on my Samsung Galaxy Chat and of course I can say that this kind of low end cellphone in its era is quite good compared to other android devices that don't provide any sensors even though the sensors in this cellphone are not very complete but help with sensors provided along with the brand from the manufacturer<br>  <br>  The first is the proximity sensor which is above the screen which functions when calling, the screen will turn off by itself and I also use this to turn on or turn off the screen on the cellphone so that the power button can be more durable and not wear out quickly, this sensor was not widely used on Android devices because when the phone is usually the screen is locked and has to be slided first if you want to turn off the phone so it's luxurious in its time you don't have to worry about pressing it when calling, the second is the magnetometer sensor if I'm not mistaken and this is what I just found out now so I can measure whether there is a magnet in an item just stick the back of the cellphone to the item, if there is a magnet, the indicator will change if it's not there then it doesn't move<br>  <br>  The third is the compass sensor, its function shows the direction at the same time it can also show the direction of the Qibla of prayer when it is in a new place, so when it started it was an error then it was calibrated by making a number like 8 with the cellphone above and rotating later it would return to normal because it was a normal error because it is disturbed by something like a magnet and must always be calibrated when using a compass to be even more accurate, the last one is the gyroscope, when playing games or to measure something like a waterpass then this sensor is very useful even though I rarely use this sensor and maybe later I will use. That's all the testing of sensors on this cellphone and if on a cellphone now it should be more complete but there are pluses and minuses, namely traceability is getting easier with complete sensors on modern cellphones
